# Torjoman | تُرجمان
Torjoman aims to make translating more accessible to general users, by translating inside the users favourite Platforms, be it chat or a website or any other platform.
So translations can be crowd sourced from even more people, which will result in more recognizable translations for normal users.

it's designed to be modular, so anyone can create a plug-in to support any new platform, using the Torjoman Plug-in API.

The project is currently in the planing phase, and you can find the documentation and the plan here(in Arabic only currently):
